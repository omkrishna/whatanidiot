Aye Reader - Welcome. (The slides below change every 15 seconds) <br><br>
<div class="mySlides fade">
It was one of my this year's <em>New Year's Resolution</em> thing (not really, it has been there for the last 4 years) - to read and write more. And that is where this blog comes into picture. The purpose of this blog is to give me stuff to write about everyday and you, some reading time - either as a great book, or an amazing article, or some important piece of news. Occasionally you might have to bear with some of my own musings, but you can always ignore them :)
</div>

<div class="mySlides fade">There are plenty of amazing apps and websites and people who publish wonderful content everyday, content that I believe can impact our day to day lives and make a difference. But. But we seem to suffer from the problem of plenty when it comes to read. The problem with so many of us isnt that we dont have stuff to read, its a bit more complicated than that - we have too much stuff to read, so much so that even thinking about all of them makes us nauseous and we postpone reading altogether.

<div class="about-text">
This about is about an <i>idiot</i> : an <i>idiot</i>  who aspires to create and write a blog every new year. The ambitious <i>idiot</i> feels that New Year Resolutions are a great inspiration, although he doesn't believe in learning from past experiences, such as his failed New Year Resolutions.<br><br>
Our <i>idiot</i> is an ardent reader, who's love for books is evident from the fact that he lives for the day he'd own a huge Hogwarts-style library in a faraway place, where all you could hear is the sound of him flipping pages, alongside long-drawn sighs, occasional laughter and sometimes sobs, interspersed with the pleasant melody of some brook nearby.<br><br>Suffering constantly from the problem-of-plenty, our <i>idiot</i> finds writing musings and book reviews for his blog as a delightful getaway from his aforementioned nauseating problem. He'd only ever write what he strongly, deeply feels about and trust me, you'd connect oh so subtly that you might not even notice the smile playing on your lips.<br><br>This <i>idiot</i> of ours is a sensitive-inside-obnoxious-outside type, and will always address you directly. <i>Aye Reader </i>, he writes like he talks and is sure to strike a chord deep down somewhere: which is why he's highly recommended by a lot of people, including yours truly and himself.<br><br>However my <i>idiot</i> is always open to constructive criticism, and if you'll let him know how horrific it is when he <i>doesnt</i> put apostrophes, he'll be sure to consider( or so I hope: he is narcissistic af).<br><br>
<div style="text-align:center;">To quote one of our dearest mutual friends, "Omi, no way! You heard what Harshita said, besides, you don't even know how to write a blog! (sighs) <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold;"> What an Idiot </span>".
