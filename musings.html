So I guess this is the new normal, that one or another part of this country will continuously burn, and that these fires will be wilfully started.<br>An incompetent government is one that cannot take a country or soceity towards stability and progress. It takes a malicious intent to push a relatively stable country into the throes of violence.<br>If the extreme brutality of what is happening at Jamia and AMU is anything to go by, what we are seeing is a vicious display of naked power, which is bent on putting people, a particular class of people, in their place in this country. All while more hate is being dog-whistled. This is planned, had been planned for many years, perhaps.<br> What coincidences of birth and time have ensured that <em>Jamia</em> is not happening to me, or my university? And how long does one bank on these coincidences to save oneself?

Most of what happens in our lives takes place in our absence: but I seem to have found from somewhere the trick of filiing in the gaps in my knowledge, so that everything is in my head, down to the last detail, such as the way the mist seemed to slant across the early morning air ... everything, and not just the few clue one stumbles across, for instance by opening an old tin trunk which should have remained cobwebby and closed.<br>Things, even people have a particular way of leaking into each other.<br><br>~Midnight's Children.

Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self motivated, not to
be touched. The things which are sacred or precious to us are things we withdraw from sharing.
I wouldn't call this selfishness or egoism - these words have been perverted. I probably think I
dont know the word for the kind of self sufficiency I mean.
A self sufficient ego is probably the only quality I demand, and appreciate. Nothing else.
