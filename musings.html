Most of what happens in our lives takes place in our absence: but I seem to have found from somewhere the trick of filiing in the gaps in my knowledge, so that everything is in my head, down to the last detail, such as the way the mist seemed to slant across the early morning air ... everything, and not just the few clue one stumbles across, for instance by opening an old tin trunk which should have remained cobwebby and closed.<br>Things, even people have a particular way of leaking into each other.<br><br>~Midnight's Children.

Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self motivated, not to
be touched. The things which are sacred or precious to us are things we withdraw from sharing.
I wouldn't call this selfishness or egoism - these words have been perverted. I probably think I
dont know the word for the kind of self sufficiency I mean.
A self sufficient ego is probably the only quality I demand, and appreciate. Nothing else.
