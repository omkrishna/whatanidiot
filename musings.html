You know you're that song
Living eternally on my lip
That long abandoned dream
That's keeps me from sleep
The love I have for you
Intensifies when I'm asleep
Give me an indication
I'll literally follow you anywhere on my jeep.
As of this moment
Let's promise not to leap
Let's promise to grow old
Together in some faraway keep.
Your name was what I sow
Your love is what I reap
I like me better when I'm with you
All my inhibitions, you sweep.
I'm obsessed with your breath and your smells
Whenever I'm with you, I just let them seep
I want to detach you from you
And I'm not being a creep.
The love I have for you
Intensifies when I'm asleep
Give me an indication
I'll literally follow you anywhere on my jeep.
All your words, letters, stories
Reside in my soul, deep.
I'm content, and if I meet my creator now
I'll ask why my fortunes were in such a big heap

Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self motivated, not to
be touched. The things which are sacred or precious to us are things we withdraw from sharing.
I wouldn't call this selfishness or egoism - these words have been perverted. I probably think I
dont know the word for the kind of self sufficiency I mean.
A self sufficient ego is probably the only quality I demand, and appreciate. Nothing else.

He gave his friends a silent look
Entertaining every thought around
Yet their story seemed like from a book
Including within romance drama dance and sound.
An epic could be made,he felt
Penning love was ever beautiful
One letter at a time,he spelt
Lad seemed adorable but the gal was dutiful.
Only often he thought it was too soon
Gee other stuff were happening too
In no way would their story be immune
Someone nevertheless would be to their rescue.
Experience an aw for this atleast, here's a poem for you.
