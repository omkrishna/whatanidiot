GONE GIRL - THE MOVIE

I couldnt read the book because I got scared - true story, no bullshit. Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot is intimidating and frightening, yet amazing. The movie sort of kicks away all ideas of having an exotic wife. In a movie where the plot revolves around the female lead, Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne makes an impression that'll last. He isnt your everydayhero. He just sorta stands in there in the background, with his flaws, and somehow makes you feel the movie couldnt have been this awesome without him.
